### Terms of Service

### The gist:

We (the [folks at MoQuality](http://moquality.com/about/)) run an AI based app testing service and would **love** for you to use it. MoQuality.com allows anyone to upload/link their apps to our service and build test cases for free, but we charge for executing the tests on real devices to find issues. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over how your application is tested. However, remember that any abuse of the service, and using it to cause harm to other services (e.g., DOS attacks, or scraping information from other places) is strictly prohibited.

#### 1. MoQuality.com and App.MoQuality.com

*   **Your Account.** If you create an account on MoQuality.com, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the applications under test. You must immediately notify MoQuality of any unauthorized uses of your account, or any other breaches of security. MoQuality will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
*   **Responsibility of Contributors.** You are entirely responsible for the applications uploaded and their content. That is the case regardless of what form the application is uploaded in, which includes, but is not limited to application binaries (apk, ipa files), source code, or URLs. By using MoQuality.com, you represent and warrant that your artifacts uploaded do not violate these Terms. By submitting an application to MoQuality for testing, you grant MoQuality a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to use/run the application(s) for the purposes of testing it under you account. This license allows MoQuality to make high-level test metrics, relating to the efficiency and effectiveness of MoQuality's service, and learnt Machine Learning models available to third parties selected by MoQuality. You also give other MoQuality.com users permission to leverage the trained Machine Learning models to be able to test their applications effectively. Even if you cancel your account, MoQuality will have the rights to retain the learnt Machine Learning models from the testing of your application. MoQuality will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.
*   **Data.** We use third party tools, Google Analytics and FullStory, Inc. (FullStory), to measure MoQuality.comâ€™s audience and usage. You agree to MoQuality storing and analyzing your usage data and the data transferred by the application under test. By upload your application on MoQuality.com and using the service, you agree to assign the data relating to your application's user interface, network traffic and the usage of the application to MoQuality and authorize us to analyze it for testing and training purposes. 
*   **Attribution.** MoQuality reserves the right to display attribution text or links in the test reports generated, attributing MoQuality.com for generating the report for example. The attribution may not be altered or removed. Attribution text or links may only be hidden if you are subscribed to MoQuality.com as an enterprise customer, and if the contract has verbiage to remove attribution.
*   **Payment and Renewal.**
    *   **General Terms.** Paid services such as test execution, integrations or reporting are available (any such services, an "Plan"). By subscribing to a Plan you agree to pay MoQuality the monthly or annual subscription fees, along with any usage fee associated for the service as indicated. Subscription payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Plan and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated.
    *   **Automatic Renewal.** Unless you notify MoQuality before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be canceled at any time in the Upgrades section of your website's dashboard.

#### 2. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy.

As MoQuality asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that materials uploaded by another user on MoQuality.com violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify MoQuality. MoQuality will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material. MoQuality will terminate a uploader's access to and use of the app on its website if, under appropriate circumstances, the uploader is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of MoQuality or others. In the case of such termination, MoQuality will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to MoQuality.

#### 3. Intellectual Property.

If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms.
